## 👋 About Me

I’m Milind — a practical, product-minded full-stack developer who ships reliable web and desktop applications. I specialize in **Laravel & modern PHP** for backend systems and have built multi-tenant SaaS modules, ERP-style workflows, APIs. I prefer roles where I can contribute to real products, solve business problems, and work in distributed teams.

I’m open to full-time remote or onsite opportunities and enjoy collaborating via Git/GitHub, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🧰 Tech & Integrations I Work With

**Backend & Databases**
- PHP, Laravel (Eloquent, Jobs, Queues, Middleware)
- MySQL, MongoDB
- Redis (caching, queues)

**Frontend**
- Blade, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- React (for SPA & Electron desktop apps)
- Minimal, pragmatic JavaScript for production UIs

**Desktop / Cross-platform**
- Electron + React (offline, filesystem access, distributed installers)
- Built an offline cross-platform Booking Desktop App as a demo/product

**APIs, Integrations & DevOps**
- RESTful APIs, Webhooks, OAuth integrations
- Payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal — integration & secure handling)
- Third-party integrations: Slack, Google Drive, external CRMs/APIs
- Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), deployments to VPS / shared hosting / cloud

**Architecture & Product**
- Multi-tenant & SaaS architectures (tenant scoping, RBAC)
- ERP-style flows (items, stock movements, work orders, invoices)
- Secure auth & role-based authorization, data migrations & seeders

---

## 🔎 What I Build / Strengths

- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms (tenant isolation, role access, billing)
- ERP modules: inventory, stock movements, purchase & production workflows
- Admin dashboards & internal tools with sensible UX (Bootstrap / AdminLTE)
- Cross-platform desktop apps (Electron) for offline-first workflows (booking, field tools)
- API-first systems with solid database design for scale and maintainability

I focus on delivering **business value**, reliable logic, and code that other engineers can maintain.

## ⭐ Notable Projects (examples to showcase)

- **ERP / SaaS Core (Flagship)** — A modular Laravel application demonstrating multi-tenant design, stock & work-order workflows, role-based access, and API endpoints for integrations. *(WIP — intended as my main showcase repo.)*

- **Booking Desktop App (Electron + React)** — Cross-platform offline booking software with local DB sync, file export, and installer builds for Windows/Linux/macOS. Demonstrates desktop packaging, filesystem access, and React-based UI.

- **Task Manager** — Web task system with status flows, assignment, due dates, and authorization policies — used to show workflow and RBAC.

(Links to repos are pinned on my GitHub profile.)
