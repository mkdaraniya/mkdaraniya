## 👋 About Me

I’m Milind, a **PHP & Laravel developer** focused on building **real-world, database-driven web applications**.  
I specialize in **backend logic, clean architecture, and practical business systems** rather than just CRUD demos.

I’ve worked on projects such as **ERP modules, task management systems, admin dashboards, and SaaS-style applications**, with strong attention to maintainability and clarity.

I’m currently **open to full-time roles (Remote or Onsite)** and looking to join a team where I can contribute to real products and grow further as a backend engineer.

**Frontend**

## 💡 What I Build

- ERP-style systems (items, stock, tasks, workflows)
- Admin dashboards & internal tools
- Role-based authentication & authorization
- Clean database-driven systems with proper migrations

I focus on **clarity, stability, and business logic**, not just flashy UI.
