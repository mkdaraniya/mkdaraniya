## About Me
I‚Äôm Milind ‚Äî a full-stack web developer specializing in **Laravel** and modern PHP. I build clean, maintainable web applications with a focus on practical features (admin dashboards, e-commerce basics, content management) and simple, usable UI using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.

I prefer remote roles and enjoy building projects that help other developers learn and that can be easily extended.
